### Toys-Price-Discrimination

#### Overview
This project utilizes data analytics to explore pricing strategies for Maven Toys, focusing on 50 retail stores in Mexico from January 2022 to September 2023. We examine how factors such as product category, cost, and market demand impact pricing decisions across diverse products, including figurines, collectibles, and plush toys.

#### Data Preprocessing
- **Scripts**: Cleaning and merging sales, product, and store data from CSV files.
- **Adjustments**: Modifying data types for cost and price fields to ensure accuracy in processing.

#### Machine Learning Models
- **XGBRegressor**: Used to predict pricing trends across different product categories and store locations.
- **Prophet Forecasting Model**: Employed to analyze and understand seasonal effects on toy sales.

#### Key Findings
- **Current Pricing Strategy**: Uniform pricing across diverse products results in suboptimal profitability due to varying cost structures and market demands.
- **Analytical Insights**: Significant seasonal fluctuations in sales and a strong correlation between higher product prices and sales volumes, especially for figurines.
- **Price Discrimination**: Evident pricing strategy reveals discrimination, with action figures employing premium pricing and animal figures priced standardly, influenced by demand elasticity and perceived value.

#### Strategic Recommendations
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Implement location-based and product-wise dynamic pricing to enhance profitability and responsiveness to market changes.
- **Product Focus**: Adjust prices for high-volume, low-margin products like Lego Bricks and Animal Figures, while promoting high-margin products through enhanced marketing strategies.

#### Impact and Challenges
- **Revenue Growth**: The project employs data-driven decision-making to improve profit margins and secure a competitive advantage.
- **Challenges**: Achieving consistent pricing across all locations and finding an optimal price for all subcategories remain significant challenges due to insufficient price variation.

#### Conclusion
The analysis underscores the necessity for Maven Toys to adopt flexible, adaptive pricing strategies to meet market demands effectively and enhance consumer satisfaction, ensuring sustained profitability and competitiveness in the market.
